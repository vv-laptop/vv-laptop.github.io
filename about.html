            <h2>What’s the Difference that Makes the Difference ?”</h2>
            <p>
                    “ I am passionate about helping leaders raise their game using important
                truths and practical approaches which have emerged working with hundreds
                of top leaders across the world and the latest scientific evidence on how to
                harness human potential. “The difference that makes the difference” are the
                insights about self and how to engage the world to succeed in their lives and on
                their terms. Only a small proportion of the population (3-5%) are able to really
                leverage their inherent power in this way. Considerable advances in our
                understanding of how to optimise human functioning and well-being allows us
                now to establish the inner roadmap and practical habits which are the
                foundational basis for outer success”

                        My experience as a business psychologist, leadership consultant and executive
                        coach spans 3 decades in leading edge boutique consultancies focused on
                        helping to assess and develop senior leaders and executives in FTSE 100
                        organisations across all sectors and all levels of the organisations, within the
                        private and public arenas. I have been able to work with hundreds of leaders in
                        global organisations to understand the internal and external factors which can
                        enable or support success as well as factors likely to impede progress and well-
                        being. My expertise in profiling has given me depth of insight and well
                        considered nuanced judgement into the characteristics and judgment needed
                        to support critical recruitment decisions, identify top performers and
                        accelerate high potential and leadership development through deploying
                        evidence-based approaches..

                <p>My area of expertise lies in deploying the new and emerging fields of positive
